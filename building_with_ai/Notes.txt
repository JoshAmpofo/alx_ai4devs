In learning to build with AI, one should start off by manually developing a project structure or base files for which the AI assistant can then upscale.
Steps:
1. Initialize a base project (manual)
2. AI-assisted structural scaffolding - use AI to structure the project for future expansion. A prompt to use can be the following:
	"I've created a new [project tech e.g. Next.js] polling app project. I want to prepare it for upcoming features like user 	authentication, viewing polls, and creating a new poll. Help me scaffold an initial folder structure and placeholder files for those 	areas. Use Shadcn components"
3. Oftentimes you may need to assist the AI in running terminal commands, review these commands carefully before running them
