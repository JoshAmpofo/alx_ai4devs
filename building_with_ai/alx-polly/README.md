## Project Docs

- **Feature overview**: Create polls with multiple choices, share via QR code, and view realâ€‘time results. See the app entry at `app/page.tsx` and auth at `app/(auth)/` for flows.

  - [`app/`](./app) â€” Next.js App Router pages, layouts, and routes
  - [`components/`](./components) â€” UI and composite components (e.g., `components/ui/*`)
  - [`lib/`](./lib) â€” clients and utilities (e.g., Supabase in `lib/supabase/*`)
  - [`types/`](./types) â€” shared TypeScript types (e.g., `types/poll.ts`)
  - [`public/`](./public) â€” static assets (icons, images)
- **Development and build scripts**: See [`package.json`](./package.json)
  - `dev`: start local dev server
  - `build`: production build
  - `start`: run built app
