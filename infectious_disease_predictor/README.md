# Infectious Disease Predictor

üîñ **Project Title & Description**  
This project is an Infectious Disease Predictor designed to analyze and forecast outbreaks of Tuberculosis (TB), with a focus on regions such as West Africa. It is intended for public health officials, researchers, and policymakers to enable timely interventions and resource allocation. The project leverages data science and AI techniques to provide accurate predictions that can help mitigate the impact of infectious diseases.

**Why Tuberculosis?**  
Tuberculosis (TB) is a major global health issue caused by the bacterium *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*. It is the leading cause of death from a single infectious agent, surpassing HIV/AIDS, with an estimated 1.5 million deaths annually worldwide. In West Africa, TB is highly prevalent, with incidence rates often exceeding 200 cases per 100,000 people, exacerbated by factors such as poverty, HIV co-infection, and limited access to healthcare.  

The importance of predicting TB outbreaks lies in its potential to save lives through early detection and intervention, preventing transmission and reducing the economic burden on affected communities. We selected TB as the disease to predict due to its high burden in the region, the availability of relevant epidemiological data, and the significant public health impact that accurate forecasting can achieve.


üõ†Ô∏è **Tech Stack**  
- **Languages:** Python  
- **Frameworks & Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch (for AI modeling), Jupyter Notebooks  
- **Database:** CSV/Parquet files for data storage; potential integration with SQL or NoSQL databases for scalability  
- **Tools:** VSCode, Git, Docker (optional for containerization)  
- **AI Tools:** OpenAI GPT models, Gemini-CLI, Claude, Github Copilot for code generation and documentation assistance  

üß† **AI Integration Strategy**  

**Code or Feature Generation**  
AI will be used to scaffold components such as data preprocessing functions, feature engineering pipelines, model training scripts, and evaluation metrics. This includes generating boilerplate code for new models, routes for APIs (if applicable), and utility functions to speed up development.

**Testing Support**  
AI will assist in generating unit and integration tests by analyzing existing functions and producing test cases that cover edge cases and typical usage scenarios. Prompts will be designed to create tests for data validation, model accuracy, and performance benchmarks.

**Schema-Aware or API-Aware Generation**  
If the project integrates with REST APIs or databases, AI will be used to generate functions based on schema definitions or OpenAPI specifications. This will help automate the creation of data access layers, validation logic, and API client code.

**Documentation**  
AI will help maintain comprehensive docstrings, inline comments, and update the README file to ensure clarity and ease of understanding for future contributors.

**Context-Aware Techniques**  
The AI workflows will incorporate project context such as API specs, file trees, and code diffs to generate relevant and accurate code snippets, tests, and documentation.

**Plan for In-Editor/PR Review Tooling**  
- Tool: CodeRabbit (or similar AI-powered code assistant)  
- Usage: Support during code reviews, pull request generation, and writing meaningful commit messages by providing AI-suggested improvements and summaries.

**Prompting Strategy**  
Sample prompts to be used with AI tools:  
- "Generate a test suite for this data preprocessing function handling missing values and outliers."  
- "Create a feature engineering pipeline for infectious disease prediction using demographic and environmental data."  
- "Write a detailed docstring for this model training function explaining inputs, outputs, and assumptions."
